{"name":"fake-identity.js","tagline":"Generate random identity objects including name, address, etc. This may be useful if you are trying to fill your application with random personal data.","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travishorn/fake-identity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travishorn/fake-identity)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Generates a single random identity or multiple identities in an array.\r\n- Includes first and last names, email address, phone number, street, city, state, zip code, date of birth, sex, company, and department.\r\n- Email address is based off of name.\r\n- First name matches sex.\r\n- All names, streets, and cities are commonly found in the US.\r\n- States are weighted on population, so more populous states appear more often.\r\n- Zip codes are loosely based on state. Zip codes are weird so it's not perfect, though.\r\n- Date of birth will be between 18 and 60.\r\n- Usable in the browser or Node.js.\r\n- No dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Browser\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your page:\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"dist/fake-identity.js\"></script>\r\n    \r\nThis will make a new global variable named `Identity` available.\r\n\r\n### Node\r\n\r\nRun\r\n\r\n    npm install fake-identity\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your application:\r\n\r\n    var Identity = require('fake-identity');\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOnce installed, just use `Identity.generate()` in your scripts to get an identity object with random values. The returned object looks like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      firstName: \"Amelia\",\r\n      lastName: \"Wright\",\r\n      emailAddress: \"awright@example.com\",\r\n      phoneNumber: \"(555) 555-0155\",\r\n      street: \"7327 Central Avenue\",\r\n      city: \"Oxford\",\r\n      state: \"TX\",\r\n      zipCode: \"75045\",\r\n      dateOfBirth: Fri Jul 20 1962 00:00:00,\r\n      sex: \"female\",\r\n      company: \"Contoso Pharmaceuticals\",\r\n      department: \"Legal\"\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nYou can also pass a number to generate more than one identity. Multiple identity objects are returned in an array like so:\r\n\r\n    Identity.generate(3);\r\n    \r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        firstName: ...\r\n        lastName: ...\r\n        ...\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        firstName: ...\r\n        lastName: ...\r\n        ...\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        firstName: ...\r\n        lastName: ...\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nRun `gulp test`.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\n- Add configuration options\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright © 2014 Travis Horn\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
